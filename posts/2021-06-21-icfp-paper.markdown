title: ICFP Paperâ€”Algebras for Weighted Search
tags: Haskell, Agda
---

The paper "Algebras for Weighted Search" has just been accepted unconditionally
to ICFP.
I wrote it with my supervisor, [Nicolas Wu](http://zenzike.com/), and it covers
a lot of the topics I've written about on this blog (including hyperfunctions
and breadth-first traversals).

The preprint is available [here](../pdfs/algebras-for-weighted-search.pdf).
