title: Weighted Search Package
tags: Haskell
---

I have packaged up the more interesting bits from the [Algebras for Weighted
Search](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3473577) paper and put it up on
hackage.

You can see it
[here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/monus-weighted-search).

It contains the `HeapT` monad, the `Monus` class, and an implementation of
Dijkstra's algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and probabilistic parsing.

Check it out!
