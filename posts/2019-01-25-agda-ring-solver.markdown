title: A New Ring Solver for Agda
tags: Agda
---

I'm finally a the point where I feel like I can make the project I've been
working on for the past few months public: [A Ring Solver for
Agda](https://oisdk.github.io/agda-ring-solver/README.html). The focus of the
project is ergonomics and ease-of-use: hopefully the interface to the solver is
simpler and more friendly than the one that's already there. It can do
step-by-step solutions (like Wolfram Alpha). It's also asymptotically faster
than the old solver (and actually faster! The usual optimizations you might
apply don't actually work here, so this bit definitely took the most work).

Anyway, this work is all for my undergrad final year project, but I'm hoping to
submit it to a conference or something in the next few weeks.
