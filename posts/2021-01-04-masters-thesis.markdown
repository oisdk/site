title: Master's Thesis

The final version of my master's thesis got approved recently so I thought I'd
post it here for people who might be interested.

[Here's the university record](https://cora.ucc.ie/handle/10468/11338).

[Here's the pdf](../pdfs/masters-thesis.pdf).

And all of the theorems in the thesis have been formalised in Agda.
The code is organised to follow the structure of the pdf [here](../code/masters-thesis/README.html).

The title of the thesis is "Finiteness in Cubical Type Theory": basically it's
all about formalising the notion of "this type is finite" in CuTT.
I also wanted to write something that could serve as a kind of introduction to
some components of modern dependent type theory which didn't go the standard
length-indexed vector route.
