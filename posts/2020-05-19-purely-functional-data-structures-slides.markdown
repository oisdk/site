title: Presentation on Purely Functional Data Structures

A week or so ago I gave a presentation on purely functional data structures as
part of an interview^[The interview went well, by the way! All going well with
my master's I'll be starting a PhD in Imperial in [Nicolas
Wu](http://zenzike.com/)'s group this October.].
Here are the slides:

The presentation is meant to be about 45 minutes long, and it's aimed at
end of first year computer science students who have done some Haskell and
know a little bit about pointers.
