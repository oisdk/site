I recently finished my undergrad degree in [UCC](https://www.ucc.ie/).
I'm putting my final-year project up here for reference purposes.

[Here](/pdfs/bsc-thesis.pdf) is the pdf.

And here’s a bibtext entry:

```
@thesis{kidney_automatically_2019,
	address = {Cork, Ireland},
	type = {Bachelor thesis},
	title = {Automatically and {Efficiently} {Illustrating} {Polynomial} {Equalities} in {Agda}},
	url = {https://doisinkidney.com/pdfs/bsc-thesis.pdf},
	abstract = {We present a new library which automates the construction of equivalence proofs between polynomials over commutative rings and semirings in the programming language Agda [20]. It is signi cantly faster than Agda’s existing solver. We use re ection to provide a sim- ple interface to the solver, and demonstrate how to use the constructed proofs to provide step-by-step solutions.},
