I'm a PhD student, studying at [Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), in the [functional
programming group](https://fp.doc.ic.ac.uk/).

I go by Ois√≠n: it's pronounced "uh-sheen".
It rhymes with the phrase "the sheen".

This site is generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a fantastic

Feel free to contact me using the links above; I'm usually ok at responding to
emails.
