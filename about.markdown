title: About
---
I'm an undergraduate computer science student, studying at
[UCC](https://www.ucc.ie) in Cork, Ireland.

I'm mainly interested in statically-typed functional programming. Currently I'm
coding in [Haskell](http://haskell.org), [Idris](http://idris-lang.org), and
[Agda](http://agda.readthedocs.io).

I go by Oisín: it's pronounced "uh-sheen", with an emphasis on the first
syllable. Kind of rhymes with machine.

This site is generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a fantastic
static site generator written in Haskell. The source code for the site is
[here](https://github.com/oisdk/site).

Feel free to contact me using the links above; I'm usually ok at responding to
emails.
