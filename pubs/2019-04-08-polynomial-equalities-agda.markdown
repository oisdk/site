title: Automatically and Efficiently Illustrating Polynomial Equalities in Agda
---

BSc thesis.

[Pdf available here.](pdfs/bsc-thesis.pdf)

We present a new library which automates the construction of equivalence proofs
between polynomials over commutative rings and semirings in the programming
language Agda. It is significantly faster than Agdaâ€™s existing solver. We use
reflection to provide a sim- ple interface to the solver, and demonstrate how to
use the constructed proofs to provide step-by-step solutions.
