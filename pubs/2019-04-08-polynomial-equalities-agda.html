<p>We present a new library which automates the construction of
equivalence proofs between polynomials over commutative rings and
semirings in the programming language Agda. It is significantly faster
than Agdaâ€™s existing solver. We use reflection to provide a sim- ple
interface to the solver, and demonstrate how to use the constructed
proofs to provide step-by-step solutions.</p>
