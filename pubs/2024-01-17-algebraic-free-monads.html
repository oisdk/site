<p>This paper presents a novel formalisation of algebraic effects with
equations in Cubical Agda. Unlike previous work in the literature that
employed setoids to deal with equations, the library presented here uses
quotient types to faithfully encode the type of terms quotiented by
laws. Apart from tools for equational reasoning, the library also
provides an effect-generic Hoare logic for algebraic effects, which
enables reasoning about effectful programs in terms of their pre- and
post- conditions. A particularly novel aspect is that equational
reasoning and Hoare-style reasoning are related by an elimination
principle of Hoare logic.</p>
