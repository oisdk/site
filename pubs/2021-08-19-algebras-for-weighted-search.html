<p>Weighted search is an essential component of many fundamental and
useful algorithms. Despite this, it is relatively under explored as a
computational effect, receiving not nearly as much attention as either
depth- or breadth-first search. This paper explores the algebraic
underpinning of weighted search, and demonstrates how to implement it as
a monad transformer. The development first explores breadth-first
search, which can be expressed as a polynomial over semirings. These
polynomials are generalised to the free semimodule monad to capture a
wide range of applications, including probability monads, polynomial
monads, and monads for weighted search. Finally, a monad transformer
based on the free semimodule monad is introduced. Applying optimisations
to this type yields an implementation of pairing heaps, which is then
used to implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and efficient probabilistic
sampling. The construction is formalised in Cubical Agda and implemented
in Haskell.</p>
