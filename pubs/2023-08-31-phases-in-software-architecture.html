<p>The large-scale structure of executing a computation can often be
thought of as being separated into distinct phases. But the most natural
form in which to specify that computation may well have a different and
conflicting structure. For example, the computation might consist of
gathering data from some locations, processing it, then distributing the
results back to the same locations; it may be executed in three
phases—gather, process, distribute—but mostly conveniently specified
orthogonally—by location. We have recently shown that this multi-phase
structure can be expressed as a novel applicative functor (also known as
an idiom, or lax monoidal functor). Here we summarize the idea from the
perspective of software architecture. At the end, we speculate about
applications to choreography and multi-tier architecture.</p>
