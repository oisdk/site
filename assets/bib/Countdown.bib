	abstract = {A nexus is a tree that contains shared nodes, nodes that have more than one incoming arc. Shared nodes are created in almost every functional program---for instance, when updating a purely functional data structure---though programmers are seldom aware of this. In fact, there are only a few algorithms that exploit sharing of nodes consciously. One example is constructing a tree in sublinear time. In this pearl we discuss an intriguing application of nexuses; we show that they serve admirably as memo structures featuring constant time access to memoized function calls. Along the way we encounter Boolean lattices and binomial trees.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Programming solves combinatorial optimization problems by recursive decomposition and tabulation of intermediate results. The first step in the design of a dynamic programming algorithm is to decide on the set of tables that will hold optimal solutions to subproblems. This step predetermines the shape of the dynamic programming recurrences as well as the asymptotic efficiency of the algorithm in time and space. We study dynamic programming in a formal framework where design of tables and problem decomposition can be done independently. Our main result shows that choosing a good table design for a given decomposition is an NP-complete problem. A heuristic or approximate approach is therefore needed to automate good table design. We report on a strategy that combines user annotation and a brute force algorithm, which is shown to perform well in a large application.},

It gives an account of the derivation of a linear-time breadth-first tree traversal algorithm, and of a subtle and efficient breadth-first tree labelling algorithm. Keywords. Derivation, functional programming, breadth-first, traversal, labelling. 1 Introduction  The algorithms which are developed in this paper relate trees to sequences in a way that respects the breadth-first ordering of the nodes of the tree: nodes nearer the root are earlier in the ordering, and nodes on the same level are ordered from left to right. We distinguish between finite and infinite sequences, which we call lists and  streams respectively. Lists of elements of type ff are modelled as the least solution  list.ff of the equation  list.ff = [ ] j ff :: list.ff  That is, the empty list [ ] has type list.ff , and if x has type ff and xs has type list.ff  then x :: xs has type list.ff .
