  abstract = {In this paper we present the Stern\textendash{}Brocot tree as a basis for performing exact arithmetic on rational numbers. There exists an elegant binary representation for positive rational numbers based on this tree [Graham et al., Concrete Mathematics, 1994]. We will study this representation by investigating various algorithms to perform exact rational arithmetic using an adaptation of the homographic and the quadratic algorithms that were first proposed by Gosper for computing with continued fractions. We will show generalisations of homographic and quadratic algorithms to multilinear forms in n variables. Finally, we show an application of the algorithms for evaluating polynomials.},

The concepts adjacency", mediant" and convergent" from the literature on Farey fractions and continued fractions are suitably extended to provide a foundation for this new binary representation system.

  title = {Fibonacci Numbers and the {{Stern}}-{{Brocot}} Tree in {{Coq}}},
  abstract = {In this paper, we study the representation of a number by some other numbers. For instance, an integer may be represented uniquely as a sum of powers of two; if each power of two is allowed to appear at most twice, the number of representations is \$s\_n\$, a sequence studied by Dijkstra, that has many nice properties proved here with the use of the proof assistant Coq. It happens that every rational number \$x\$ is uniquely the quotient \$s\_n/s\_\{n+1\}\$ as noticed by Stern, and that the integer \$n\$ is related to the continued fraction expansion of \$x\$. It happens that by reverting the bits on \$n\$, one gets a sequence of rational numbers with increasing denominators that goes from 1 to \$x\$ and becomes nearer at each iteration; this was studied by Brocot, whence the name Stern-Brocot tree. An integer can also be represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers; we study \$R(n)\$ the number of such representations; there is uniqueness for the predecessors of Fibonacci numbers; there is also uniqueness under additional constraints (for instance, no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers can be used, or no two consecutive numbers can be omitted).},

This deals with the subtle points of undecidable comparison an integer division, as well as representing the infinite 1/0 and undefined 0/0 numbers. Two general algorithms for performing arithmetic operations are introduced. The algebraic algorithm, which computes sums and products of continued fractions as a special case, basically operates in a positional manner, producing one term of output for each term of input. The transcendental algorithm uses a general formula of Gauss to compute the continued fractions of exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, as well as a wide class of special functions. A prototype system has been implemented in LeLisp, and the performance of these algorithms is promising.},
