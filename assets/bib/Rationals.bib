There exists an elegant binary representation for positive rational numbers based on this tree [Graham et al., Concrete Mathematics, 1994]. We will study this representation by investigating various algorithms to perform exact rational arithmetic using an adaptation of the homographic and the quadratic algorithms that were first proposed by Gosper for computing with continued fractions. We will show generalisations of homographic and quadratic algorithms to multilinear forms in n variables. Finally, we show an application of the algorithms for evaluating polynomials.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the representation of a number by some other numbers. For instance, an integer may be represented uniquely as a sum of powers of two; if each power of two is allowed to appear at most twice, the number of representations is \$s\_n\$, a sequence studied by Dijkstra, that has many nice properties proved here with the use of the proof assistant Coq. It happens that every rational number \$x\$ is uniquely the quotient \$s\_n/s\_\{n+1\}\$ as noticed by Stern, and that the integer \$n\$ is related to the continued fraction expansion of \$x\$. It happens that by reverting the bits on \$n\$, one gets a sequence of rational numbers with increasing denominators that goes from 1 to \$x\$ and becomes nearer at each iteration; this was studied by Brocot, whence the name Stern-Brocot tree. An integer can also be represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers; we study \$R(n)\$ the number of such representations; there is uniqueness for the predecessors of Fibonacci numbers; there is also uniqueness under additional constraints (for instance, no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers can be used, or no two consecutive numbers can be omitted).},

Two general algorithms for performing arithmetic operations are introduced. The algebraic algorithm, which computes sums and products of continued fractions as a special case, basically operates in a positional manner, producing one term of output for each term of input. The transcendental algorithm uses a general formula of Gauss to compute the continued fractions of exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, as well as a wide class of special functions. A prototype system has been implemented in LeLisp, and the performance of these algorithms is promising.},

The aim is to provide a tractable starting point for formal analysis and further development. In addition the program presented here allows beginners to the field to easily experiment with a practical implementation in order to understand some of the issues involved. The algorithms used have been validated using PVS which provides some grounds for believing them to be correct. However, as neither PVS nor Haskell have been similarly validated, semantic problems in either PVS or Haskell might still undermine the work. A slightly shorter program with the same functionality could be written, but there would be a significant degradation in performance. By performing better range reduction, the performance could be increased. However, we would lose the correctness proofs and the program would become a bit longer and even more opaque.},

We choose the constructive type theory as our formal verification tool. We discuss an extension of the constructive type theory with coinductive types that enables one to formalise and reason about the infinite objects. We show examples of how infinite objects such as streams and expression trees can be formalised as coinductive types. We study the type theoretic notion of productivity which ensures the infiniteness of the outcome of the algorithms on infinite objects. Syntactical methods are not always strong enough to ensure the productivity. However, if some information about the complexity of a function is provided, one may be able to show the productivity of that function. In the case of the normalisation algorithm we show that such information can be obtained from the choice of real number representation that is used to represent the input and the output.},
