  abstract = {In a purely functional setting, real-time queues are traditionally thought to be much harder to implement than either real-time stacks or amortized O(1) queues. In ``Circular Programs and Self-Referential Structures,'' [1] Lloyd Allison uses corecursion to implement a queue by defining a lazy list in terms of itself. This provides a simple, efficient, and attractive implementation of real-time queues.},
