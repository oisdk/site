  abstract = {We develop the theory and practical implementation of p-adic sparse coding of data. Rather than the standard, sparsifying criterion that uses the \$L\_0\$ pseudo-norm, we use the p-adic norm. We require that the hierarchy or tree be node-ranked, as is standard practice in agglomerative and other hierarchical clustering, but not necessarily with decision trees. In order to structure the data, all computational processing operations are direct reading of the data, or are bounded by a constant number of direct readings of the data, implying linear computational time. Through p-adic sparse data coding, efficient storage results, and for bounded p-adic norm stored data, search and retrieval are constant time operations. Examples show the effectiveness of this new approach to content-driven encoding and displaying of data.},

The p-adic coding algorithm may be considered as a generalization of a popular compression technique \textendash{} arithmetic coding algorithms.

The new scheme uses a compact variable-length encoding that may be viewed as a generalization of radix complement notation. It allows exact arithmetic, and approximate arithmetic under programmer control. It is superior to existing coding methods because the arithmetic operations take particularly simple, consistent forms. These attributes make the new number representation attractive for use in computer hardware.},

In analogy with universal algebra, universal coalgebra is developed parametric in the system type T , and by varying T we recover known structures such as trees, automata, Markov chains and many more. Streams arise as the behaviours of a very simple type of coalgebra, and form a final coalgebra. A final coalgebra yields a proof and definition principle called coinduction, which is dual to the more well known princple of induction.},

Because work in the univalent setting is ongoing, the structure and organization of the construction of the p-adic numbers we give in this paper is expected to change as Coq libraries are more suitably rearranged, and optimized, by the authors and other researchers in the future. So our construction here should be deemed as a first approximation which is subject to improvements.},
