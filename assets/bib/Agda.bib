We derive natural properties for the Kleene star of cycle-free series and also of matrices often used to analyze the behavior of weighted automata. Finally, we investigate cycle-free linear equations which provide a useful tool for proving identities for formal power series.},

In these notes, we show how to arrive at the efficient, two-continuation based backtracking monad derived by Hinze starting from an intuitive inefficient implementation that we subsequently refine using well known program transformations.
It turns out that the technique can be used to build monads for non-determinism from modular, independent parts which gives rise to various new implementations. Specifically, we show how the presented approach can be applied to obtain new implementations of breadth-first search and iterative deepening depth-first search.},

Secondly, we show that even though the pattern of recursion encapsulated by fold is simple, in a language with tuples and functions as first-class values the fold operator has greater expressive power than might first be expected.},

The result is fully implemented in GHC, and is in use at Facebook to make it easy to write highly-parallel queries in a distributed system.},

The semantics of programs is defined in terms of first-order structures with semiring labels, which allows us to freely combine and integrate problems from different AI disciplines.},

  abstract = {Haskell, as implemented in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), has been adding new type-level programming features for some time. Many of these features---chiefly: generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs), type families, kind polymorphism, and promoted datatypes---have brought Haskell to the doorstep of dependent types. Many dependently typed programs can even currently be encoded, but often the constructions are painful. In this dissertation, I describe Dependent Haskell, which supports full dependent types via a backward-compatible extension to today's Haskell. An important contribution of this work is an implementation, in GHC, of a portion of Dependent Haskell, with the rest to follow. The features I have implemented are already released, in GHC 8.0. This dissertation contains several practical examples of Dependent Haskell code, a full description of the differences between Dependent Haskell and today's Haskell, a novel type-safe dependently typed lambda-calculus (called Pico) suitable for use as an intermediate language for compiling Dependent Haskell, and a type inference and elaboration algorithm, Bake, that translates Dependent Haskell to type-correct Pico.},

A metamorphism is the opposite composition, an unfold after a fold; typically, it will convert from one data representation to another. In general, metamorphisms are less interesting than hylomorphisms: there is no automatic fusion to deforest the intermediate virtual data structure. However, under certain conditions fusion is possible: some of the work of the unfold can be done before all of the work of the fold is complete. This permits streaming metamorphisms, and among other things allows conversion of infinite data representations. We present a theory of metamorphisms and outline some examples.},

  abstract = {Local computation in join trees or acyclic hypertrees has been shown to be linked to a particular algebraic structure, called valuation algebra. There are many models of this algebraic structure ranging from probability theory to numerical analysis, relational databases and various classical and non-classical logics. It turns out that many interesting models of valuation algebras may be derived from semiring valued mappings. In this paper we study how valuation algebras are induced by semirings and how the structure of the valuation algebra is related to the algebraic structure of the semiring. In particular, c-semirings with idempotent multiplication induce idempotent valuation algebras and therefore permit particularly efficient architectures for local computation. Also important are semirings whose multiplicative semigroup is embedded in a union of groups. They induce valuation algebras with a partially defined division. For these valuation algebras, the well-known architectures for Bayesian networks apply. We also extend the general computational framework to allow derivation of bounds and approximations, for when exact computation is not feasible.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {0218-2130},
  abstract = {Computing inference from a given knowledgebase is one of the key competences of computer science. Therefore, numerous formalisms and specialized inference routines have been introduced and implemented for this task. Typical examples are Bayesian networks, constraint systems or different kinds of logic. It is known today that these formalisms can be unified under a common algebraic roof called valuation algebra. Based on this system, generic inference algorithms for the processing of arbitrary valuation algebras can be defined. Researchers benefit from this high level of abstraction to address open problems independently of the underlying formalism. It is therefore all the more astonishing that this theory did not find its way into concrete software projects. Indeed, all modern programming languages for example provide generic sorting procedures, but generic inference algorithms are still mythical creatures. NENOK breaks a new ground and offers an extensive library of generic inference tools based on the valuation algebra framework. All methods are implemented as distributed algorithms that process local and remote knowledgebases in a transparent manner. Besides its main purpose as software library, NENOK also provides a sophisticated graphical user interface to inspect the inference process and the involved graphical structures. This can be used for educational purposes but also as a fast prototyping architecture for inference formalisms.},

  abstract = {A representation of lists as first-class functions is proposed. Lists represented in this way can be appended together in constant time, and can be converted back into ordinary lists in time proportional to their length. Programs which construct lists using append can often be improved by using this representation. For example, naive reverse can be made to run in linear time, and the conventional `fast reverse' can then be derived easily. Examples are given in KRC (Turner, 1982), the notation being explained as it is introduced. The method can be compared to Sleep and Holmstr\"om's proposal (1982) to achieve a similar effect by a change to the interpreter.},

  title = {Numerical {{Representations}} as {{Higher}}-{{Order Nested Datatypes}}},
  abstract = {Number systems serve admirably as templates for container types: a container object of size n is modelled after the representation of the number n and operations on container objects are modelled after their number-theoretic counterparts. Binomial queues are probably the first data structure that was designed with this analogy in mind. In this paper we show how to express these so-called numerical representations as higher-order nested datatypes. A nested datatype allows to capture the structural invariants of a numerical representation, so that the violation of an invariant can be detected at compile-time. We develop a programming method which allows to adapt algorithms to the new representation in a mostly straightforward manner. The framework is employed to implement three different container types: binary random-access lists, binomial queues, and 2-3 finger search trees. The latter data structure, which is treated in some depth, can be seen as the main innovation from a data-struct...},

Inspired by logic programming, our library provides, in addition to the operations required by the MonadPlus interface, constructs for fair disjunctions, fair conjunctions, conditionals, pruning, and an expressive top-level interface. Implementing these additional constructs is easy in models of backtracking based on streams, but not known to be possible in continuation-based models. We show that all these additional constructs can be generically and monadically realized using a single primitive msplit. We present two implementations of the library: one using success and failure continuations; and the other using control operators for manipulating delimited continuations.},

This paper investigates the theoretical underpinnings of this transformation in the categorical setting of monads. We argue that so-called absolute Kan Extensions underlie this program optimisation. It is known that every Kan extension gives rise to a monad, the codensity monad, and furthermore that every monad is isomorphic to a codensity monad. The end formula for Kan extensions then induces an implementation of the monad, which can be seen as the categorical counterpart of continuation-passing style. We show that several optimisations are instances of this scheme: Church representations and implementation of backtracking using success and failure continuations, among others. Furthermore, we develop the calculational properties of Kan extensions, powers and ends. In particular, we propose a two-dimensional notation based on string diagrams that aims to support effective reasoning with Kan extensions.},

  abstract = {Monads are a well-established tool for modelling various computational effects. They form the semantic basis of Moggi's computational metalanguage, the metalanguage of effects for short, which made its way into modern functional programming in the shape of Haskell's do-notation. Standard computational idioms call for specific classes of monads that support additional control operations. Here, we introduce Kleene monads, which additionally feature nondeterministic choice and Kleene star, i.e. nondeterministic iteration, and we provide a metalanguage and a sound calculus for Kleene monads, the metalanguage of control and effects, which is the natural joint extension of Kleene algebra and the metalanguage of effects. This provides a framework for studying abstract program equality focussing on iteration and effects. These aspects are known to have decidable equational theories when studied in isolation. However, it is well known that decidability breaks easily; e.g. the Horn theory of continuous Kleene algebras fails to be recursively enumerable. Here, we prove several negative results for the metalanguage of control and effects; in particular, already the equational theory of the unrestricted metalanguage of control and effects over continuous Kleene monads fails to be recursively enumerable. We proceed to identify a fragment of this language which still contains both Kleene algebra and the metalanguage of effects and for which the natural axiomatisation is complete, and indeed the equational theory is decidable.},

This definition has some desirable properties: Many bag equivalences can be proved using a flexible form of equational reasoning. The definition generalises easily to arbitrary unary containers, including types with infinite values, such as streams. By using a slight variation of the definition one gets set equivalence instead, i.e. equality up to order and multiplicity. Other variations give the subset and subbag preorders. The definition works well in mechanised proofs.},

To achieve good time bounds essential use is often made of laziness. The associated complexity analysis is frequently subtle, requiring careful attention to detail, and hence formalising it is valuable. This paper describes a simple library which can be used to make the analysis of a class of purely functional data structures and algorithms almost fully formal. The basic idea is to use the type system to annotate every function with the time required to compute its result. An annotated monad is used to combine time complexity annotations. The library has been used to analyse some existing data structures, for instance the deque operations of Hinze and Paterson's finger trees.},

Intervals, lists and binary search trees are instances of the generic treatment. On the journey to this treatment, I report a variety of failed experiments and the transferable learning experiences they triggered. I demonstrate that a total element ordering is enough to deliver insertion and flattening algorithms, and show that (with care about the formulation of the types) the implementations remain as usual. Agda's instance arguments and pattern synonyms maximize the proof search done by the typechecker and minimize the appearance of proofs in program text, often eradicating them entirely. Generalizing to indexed recursive container types, invariants such as size and balance can be expressed in addition to ordering. By way of example, I implement insertion and deletion for 2-3 trees, ensuring both order and balance by the discipline of type checking.},

This is achieved by endowing the usual probability monads (like the Giry monad) with a monoidal and an opmonoidal structure, mutually compatible (i.e. a bimonoidal structure). If the underlying monoidal category is cartesian monoidal, a bimonoidal structure is given uniquely by a commutative strength. However, if the underlying monoidal category is not cartesian monoidal, a strength is not enough to guarantee all the desired properties of joints and marginals. A bimonoidal structure is then the correct requirement for the more general case. We explain the theory and the operational interpretation, with the help of the graphical calculus for monoidal categories. We give a definition of stochastic independence based on the bimonoidal structure, compatible with the intuition and with other approaches in the literature for cartesian monoidal categories. We then show as an example that the Kantorovich monad on the category of complete metric spaces is a bimonoidal monad for a non-cartesian monoidal structure.},

This paper builds on the observation that datatypes often carry additional structure that containers alone do not account for. We introduce directed containers to capture the common situation where every position in a datastructure determines another datastructure, informally, the sub-datastructure rooted by that position. Some natural examples are non-empty lists and node-labelled trees, and datastructures with a designated position (zippers). While containers denote set functors via a fully-faithful functor, directed containers interpret fully-faithfully into comonads. But more is true: every comonad whose underlying functor is a container is represented by a directed container. In fact, directed containers are the same as containers that are comonads. We also describe some constructions of directed containers. We have formalized our development in the dependently typed programming language Agda.},

We compare 20 BST variants using three experiments in real-world scenarios with real and artificial workloads. The results indicate that when input is expected to be randomly ordered with occasional runs of sorted order, red-black trees are preferred; when insertions often occur in sorted order, AVL trees excel for later random access, whereas splay trees perform best for later sequential or clustered access. For node representations, use of parent pointers is shown to be the fastest choice, with threaded nodes a close second choice that saves memory; nodes without parent pointers or threads suffer when traversal and modification are combined; maintaining a in-order doubly linked list is advantageous when traversal is very common; and right-threaded nodes perform poorly.},

We show that this construction allows inductive implementation of polynomial operations such as arithmetic, evaluation, substitution, etc. Furthermore, we can transform a polynomial expression into in a sequence of arithmetic expressions in the base ring and prove the correctness of this transformation in Agda. Combined with our recursive construction, this allows for compiling polynomial expressions over a tower of extension fields into scalar expressions over the ground field, for example. Such a technique is not only interesting in its own right but also finds plentiful application in research areas such as cryptography.},

  shorttitle = {Causality for Free!},
  abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a model of reactive systems in which signals are time-dependent values, and signal functions are functions between signals. Signal functions are required to be causal, in that output behaviour at time t is only allowed to depend on input behaviour up to time t. In order to enforce causality, many FRP libraries are arrowized, in that they provide combinators for building signal functions, rather than allowing users to write functions directly. In this paper, we provide a definition of deep causality (which coincides with the usual definition on signals of base type, but differs on nested signals). We show that FRP types can be interpreted in System F{$\omega$} extended with a kind of time, and show that in this interpretation, a ``theorems for free'' argument shows that parametric functions are deep causal. Since all System F{$\omega$} functions are parametric, this implies that all implementable functions are deep causal. This model is the formal basis of the agda-frp-js FRP library for the dependently typed programming language Agda, which compiles to JavaScript and executes in the browser. Assuming parametricity of Agda, this allows reactive programs to be written as regular functions over signals, without sacrificing causality. All results in this paper have been mechanically verified in Agda.},

The library's interface is similar to those of many other parser combinator libraries, with two important differences: one is that the interface clearly specifies which parts of the constructed parsers may be infinite, and which parts have to be finite, using dependent types and a combination of induction and coinduction; and the other is that the parser type is unusually informative. The library comes with a formal semantics, using which it is proved that the parser combinators are as expressive as possible.

  abstract = {Semirings provide a simple abstract model of the syntax for a nondeterministic programming language. Each element of a semiring is a nondeterministic program segment, and the semiring operations (+ and {$\uplus$}) correspond to nondeterministic or and program composition. This is analogous to using an algebraic theory for the abstract syntax of a deterministic language. In the case of algebraic theories, an algebra provides the semantics, and free algebras (which always exist) are particularly important. For a semiring, semantics is provided by a representation as a system of relations. This paper examines the question of when free representations exist. Unlike free algebras, free representations do not always exist. It is shown that a semiring has free representations generated by arbitrary sets of variables iff it has a free representation generated by a single variable. Examples of semirings are given that do not have free representations. However, for an important class of semirings, free representations are always available. This class consists of semirings which arise when nondeterminism is freely added to a deterministic programming language.},

The congruence on propositions is handled through rewrite rules and equational axioms. Rewrite rules apply to terms but also directly to atomic propositions.The second contribution is to give a complete proof search method, called extended narrowing and resolution (ENAR), for theorem proving modulo such congruences. The completeness of this method is proved with respect to provability in sequent calculus modulo.An important application is that higher-order logic can be presented as a theory in deduction modulo.

  abstract = {One difficulty with reasoning and programming with dependent types is that proof obligations arise naturally once programs become even moderately sized. For example, implementing an adder for binary numbers indexed over their natural number equivalents naturally leads to proof obligations for equalities of expressions over natural numbers. The need for these equality proofs comes, in intensional type theories, from the fact that the propositional equality enables us to prove as equal terms that are not judgementally equal, which means that the typechecker can't always obtain equalities by reduction. As far as possible, we would like to solve such proof obligations automatically. In this paper, we show one way to automate these proofs by reflection in the dependently typed programming language Idris. We show how defining reflected terms indexed by the original Idris expression allows us to construct and manipulate proofs. We build a hierarchy of tactics for proving equivalences in semigroups, monoids, commutative monoids, groups, commutative groups, semi-rings and rings. We also show how each tactic reuses those from simpler structures, thus avoiding duplication of code and proofs.},

This applies in particular to specifications written in the form of Galois connections, in which one of the adjoints delivers the optimal solution.

  abstract = {Many programming tasks can be specified as optimisation problems in which a relation is used to generate all possible solutions, from which we wish to choose an optimal one. A relational operator ``shrink'', developed by Jos\'e N. Oliveira, is particularly suitable for constructing greedy algorithms from such specifications. Meanwhile, it has become standard in many sub-fields in programming language that proofs must be machine-verified. This tutorial leads the readers through the development of algebraic derivations of three greedy algorithms, one fold-based and two unfold-based, using AoPA, a library designed for machine-verified relational program calculation.},

  title = {The {{View}} from the {{Left}}},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {0956-7968},
  abstract = {Pattern matching has proved an extremely powerful and durable notion in functional programming. This paper contributes a new programming notation for type theory which elaborates the notion in various ways. First, as is by now quite well-known in the type theory community, definition by pattern matching becomes a more discriminating tool in the presence of dependent types, since it refines the explanation of types as well as values. This becomes all the more true in the presence of the rich class of datatypes known as inductive families (Dybjer, 1991). Secondly, as proposed by Peyton Jones (1997) for Haskell, and independently rediscovered by us, subsidiary case analyses on the results of intermediate computations, which commonly take place on the right-hand side of definitions by pattern matching, should rather be handled on the left. In simply-typed languages, this subsumes the trivial case of Boolean guards; in our setting it becomes yet more powerful. Thirdly, elementary pattern matching decompositions have a well-defined interface given by a dependent type; they correspond to the statement of an induction principle for the datatype. More general, user-definable decompositions may be defined which also have types of the same general form. Elementary pattern matching may therefore be recast in abstract form, with a semantics given by translation. Such abstract decompositions of data generalize Wadler's (1987) notion of `view'. The programmer wishing to introduce a new view of a type \$\textbackslash{}mathit\{T\}\$, and exploit it directly in pattern matching, may do so via a standard programming idiom. The type theorist, looking through the Curry\textendash{}Howard lens, may see this as proving a theorem, one which establishes the validity of a new induction principle for \$\textbackslash{}mathit\{T\}\$. We develop enough syntax and semantics to account for this high-level style of programming in dependent type theory. We close with the development of a typechecker for the simply-typed lambda calculus, which furnishes a view of raw terms as either being well-typed, or containing an error. The implementation of this view is ipso facto a proof that typechecking is decidable.},

@article{cockx_pattern_nodate,
  title = {Pattern {{Matching Without K}}},
  abstract = {Dependent pattern matching is an intuitive way to write programs and proofs in dependently typed languages. It is reminiscent of both pattern matching in functional languages and case analysis in on-paper mathematics. However, in general it is incompatible with new type theories such as homotopy type theory (HoTT). As a consequence, proofs in such theories are typically harder to write and to understand. The source of this incompatibility is the reliance of dependent pattern matching on the so-called K axiom \textendash{} also known as the uniqueness of identity proofs \textendash{} which is inadmissible in HoTT. The Agda language supports an experimental criterion to detect definitions by pattern matching that make use of the K axiom, but so far it lacked a formal correctness proof. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for dependent pattern matching without K, and prove it correct by a translation to eliminators in the style of Goguen et al. (2006). Our criterion both allows more good definitions than existing proposals, and solves a previously undetected problem in the criterion offered by Agda. It has been implemented in Agda and is the first to be supported by a formal proof. Thus it brings the benefits of dependent pattern matching to contexts where we cannot assume K, such as HoTT. It also points the way to new forms of dependent pattern matching, for example on higher inductive types.},

Unlike finite data which is defined by constructors we define infinite data by observations.

This leads to a symmetric language design where pattern matching on finite and infinite data can be mixed.},

  abstract = {We design and implement a library that solves the long-standing problem of combining effects without imposing restrictions on their interactions (such as static ordering). Effects arise from interactions between a client and an effect handler (interpreter); interactions may vary throughout the program and dynamically adapt to execution conditions. Existing code that relies on monad transformers may be used with our library with minor changes, gaining efficiency over long monad stacks. In addition, our library has greater expressiveness, allowing for practical idioms that are inefficient, cumbersome, or outright impossible with monad transformers. Our alternative to a monad transformer stack is a single monad, for the coroutine-like communication of a client with its handler. Its type reflects possible requests, i.e., possible effects of a computation. To support arbitrary effects and their combinations, requests are values of an extensible union type, which allows adding and, notably, subtracting summands. Extending and, upon handling, shrinking of the union of possible requests is reflected in its type, yielding a type-and-effect system for Haskell. The library is lightweight, generalizing the extensible exception handling to other effects and accurately tracking them in types.},

  abstract = {Haskell's type system has outgrown its Hindley-Milner roots to the extent that it now stretches to the basics of dependently typed programming. In this paper, we collate and classify techniques for programming with dependent types in Haskell, and contribute some new ones. In particular, through extended examples---merge-sort and rectangular tilings---we show how to exploit Haskell's constraint solver as a theorem prover, delivering code which, as Agda programmers, we envy. We explore the compromises involved in simulating variations on the theme of the dependent function space in an attempt to help programmers put dependent types to work, and to inform the evolving language design both of Haskell and of dependently typed languages more broadly.},

  abstract = {Describing a problem using classical linear algebra is a very well-known problem-solving technique. If your question can be formulated as a question about real or complex matrices, then the answer can often be found by standard techniques. It's less well-known that very similar techniques still apply where instead of real or complex numbers we have a closed semiring, which is a structure with some analogue of addition and multiplication that need not support subtraction or division. We define a typeclass in Haskell for describing closed semirings, and implement a few functions for manipulating matrices and polynomials over them. We then show how these functions can be used to calculate transitive closures, find shortest or longest or widest paths in a graph, analyse the data flow of imperative programs, optimally pack knapsacks, and perform discrete event simulations, all by just providing an appropriate underlying closed semiring.},

The price they pay for this flexibility is often the need to build and check explicit proof objects which can be expensive. In this work we develop a collection of techniques for building reflective automation, where proofs are witnessed by verified decision procedures rather than verbose proof objects. Our techniques center around a verified domain specific language for proving, Rtac, written in Gallina, Coq's logic. The design of tactics makes it easy to combine them into higher-level automation that can be proved sound in a mostly automated way. Furthermore, unlike traditional uses of reflection, Rtac tactics are independent of the underlying problem domain. This allows them to be re-tasked to automate new problems with very little effort. We demonstrate the usability of Rtac through several case studies demonstrating orders of magnitude speedups for relatively little engineering work.},

  abstract = {Harper's 1999 Functional Pearl on regular expression matching is a strong example of the interplay between programming and proof, and has been used for many years in introductory functional programming classes. In this paper, we revisit this algorithm from the point of view of dependently typed programming. In the process of formalizing the algorithm and its correctness using the Agda proof assistant, we found three interesting variations. First, defunctionalizing the matcher allows Agda to see termination without an explicit metric, and provides a simple first-order matcher with a clear relationship to the original, giving an alternative to a later Educational Pearl by Yi. Second, intrinsically verifying the soundness of the algorithm has useful computational content, allowing the extraction of matching strings from the parse tree. Third, while Harper uses a negative definition of standard regular expressions (no starred subexpression accepts the empty string), using a syntactic definition of standardness simplifies the staging of the development. These variations provide a nice illustration of the benefits of thinking in a dependently typed language, and have some pedagogical value for streamlining and extending the presentation of this material. {${_\ast}$}This material is based on research sponsored in part by by The United States Air Force Research Laboratory under agreement number FA9550-15-1-0053.

The essential idea is to track structural descent and guardedness in the type system to make termination checking robust and suitable for strong abstractions like higher-order functions and polymorphism. To study the application of sized types to proof assistants and programming languages based on dependent type theory, we have implemented a core language, MiniAgda, with explicit handling of sizes. New considerations were necessary to soundly integrate sized types with dependencies and pattern matching, which was made possible by modern concepts such as inaccessible patterns and parametric function spaces. This paper provides an introduction to MiniAgda by example and informal explanations of the underlying principles. 1},

  abstract = {Some programs are doubly-generic. For example, map is datatypegeneric in that many different data structures support a mapping operation. A generic programming language like Generic Haskell can use a single definition to generate map for each type. However, map is also arity-generic because it belongs to a family of related operations that differ in the number of arguments. For lists, this family includes repeat, map, zipWith, zipWith3, zipWith4, etc. With dependent types or clever programming, one can unify all of these functions together in a single definition.},

The paper describes a way to allow a general recursion operator in type theory (extended with propositions). A proof rule for the new operator is presented. The addition of the new operator will not distroy the property that all well-typed programs terminate. An advantage of the new program construct is that it is possible to separate the termination proof of the program from the proof of other properties.},

  title = {Wellfounded {{Recursion}} with {{Copatterns}}},
  abstract = {In this paper, we study strong normalization of a core language based on System F{$\omega$} which supports programming with finite and infinite structures. Building on our prior work, finite data such as finite lists and trees are defined via constructors and manipulated via pattern matching, while infinite data such as streams and infinite trees is defined by observations and synthesized via copattern matching. In this work, we take a type-based approach to strong normalization by tracking size information about finite and infinite data in the type. This guarantees compositionality. More importantly, the duality of pattern and copatterns provide a unifying semantic concept which allows us for the first time to elegantly and uniformly support both well-founded induction and coinduction by mere rewriting. The strong normalization proof is structured around Girard's reducibility candidates. As such our system allows for non-determinism and does not rely on coverage. Since System F{$\omega$} is general enough that it can be the target of compilation for the Calculus of Constructions, this work is a significant step towards representing observation-centric infinite data in proof assistants such as Coq and Agda.},

Formalised mathematics has started to attract the attention of mainstream mathematicians such as Harvey Friedman, Tim Gow- ers and Tom Hales. Nevertheless, there is much disagreement on the details of formalisms (constructive or classical, typed or typeless), proof languages (linear or structured) and automation (minimal, heuristic or algorithmic). The recent translation of the HOL Light multivariate analysis library to Isabelle highlights some of these di􏰀erences. The speaker will address these issues, referencing recent developments in the formalisation of real alge- braic geometry.},

The compiler is written in Haskell and uses LLVM, a framework for building optimizing compiler backends. It can compile the complete standard library provided by LambdaPi's authors into native machine code. It is not much of an optimizing compiler, but several obvious opportunities for improvement exist.
First I discuss the theoretical background of project: the principles of dependent types and the languages which include them. I also give a brief overview of the LLVM system and of related work. The second section describes the process of implementation, which was done in stages from a trivial calculator language up to full LambdaPi. And finally we consider opportunities for optimization. Some of these stem from Edwin Brady's [2005] analysis of Epigram, while others are lower-level and can be performed for us by LLVM.},

In this paper we introduce a bounded linear typing discipline on a general notion of resource which can be modeled in a semiring. For this type system we provide both a general type-inference procedure, parameterized by the decision procedure of the semiring equational theory, and a (coherent) categorical semantics. This could be a useful type-theoretic and denotational framework for resource-sensitive compilation, and it represents a generalization of several existing type systems. As a nontrivial instance, motivated by hardware compilation, we present a complex new application to calculating and controlling timing of execution in a (recursion-free) higher-order functional programming language with local store.},

  abstract = {One of the leading textbooks for formal methods is Software Foundations (SF), written by Benjamin Pierce in collaboration with others, and based on Coq. After five years using SF in the classroom, I have come to the conclusion that Coq is not the best vehicle for this purpose, as too much of the course needs to focus on learning tactics for proof derivation, to the cost of learning programming language theory. Accordingly, I have written a new textbook, Programming Language Foundations in Agda (PLFA). PLFA covers much of the same ground as SF, although it is not a slavish imitation.},

  title = {Haskell {{Programming}} with {{Nested Types}}: {{A Principled Approach}}},
  abstract = {Initial algebra semantics is one of the cornerstones of the theory of modern functional programming languages. For each inductive data type, it provides a Church encoding for that type, a build combinator which constructs data of that type, a fold combinator which encapsulates structured recursion over data of that type, and a fold/build rule which optimises modular programs by eliminating from them data constructed using the build combinator, and immediately consumed using the fold combinator, for that type. It has long been thought that initial algebra semantics is not expressive enough to provide a similar foundation for programming with nested types in Haskell. Specifically, the standard folds derived from initial algebra semantics have been considered too weak to capture commonly occurring patterns of recursion over data of nested types in Haskell, and no build combinators or fold/build rules have until now been defined for nested types. This paper shows that standard folds are, in fact, sufficiently expressive for programming with nested types in Haskell. It also defines build combinators and fold/build fusion rules for nested types. It thus shows how initial algebra semantics provides a principled, expressive, and elegant foundation for programming with nested types in Haskell.},

The bit-reversal permutation swaps elements whose indices have binary representations that are the reverse of each other. Using an amortized approach this operation can be made to run in linear time on a random-access machine. An intriguing question is whether a linear-time implementation is also feasible on a pointer machine, that is in a purely functional setting. We show that the answer to this question is in the affirmative. In deriving a solution we employ several advanced programming language concepts such as nested datatypes, associated fold and unfold operators, rank-2 types, and polymorphic recursion. 1 Introduction A bit-reversal permutation operates on lists whose length is n = 2 k for some natural number k and swaps elements whose indices have binary representations that are the reverse of eac...},

These fancy types have a type index (e.g., type level natural numbers) with an equality relation that is difficult or impossible to represent using GHC's built-in type equality. The most practical way to represent these equality relations is through a plugin that asserts equality constraints. However, such plugins are difficult to write and reason about.   In this paper, we (1) present a formal theory of reasoning about the correctness of type checker plugins for type indices, and, (2) apply this theory in creating Thoralf, a generic and extensible plugin for type indices that translates GHC constraint problems to queries to an external SMT solver. By "generic and extensible", we mean the restrictions on extending Thoralf are slight, and, if some type index could be encoded as an SMT sort, then a programmer could extend Thoralf by providing this encoding function.},

We have developed a decision procedure on abelian rings in the Coq system but the approach we describe applies to all reduction systems that allow the definition of concrete types (or datatypes). We show that computational reflection is more efficient than an LCF-like approach to implement decision procedures in a reduction system. We discuss the concept of total reflection, which we have investigated in Coq using two facts: the extraction process available in Coq and the fact that the implementation language of the Coq system can be considered as a sublanguage of Coq. Total reflection is not yet implemented in Coq but we can test its performance as the extraction process is effective. Both reflection and total reflection are conservative extensions of the reduction system in which they are used. We also discuss performance and related approaches. In the paper,we assume basic knowledges of ML and proof-checkers.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a minimalistic and elegant approach to working with graphs in Haskell. It is built on a rigorous mathematical foundation --- an algebra of graphs --- that allows us to apply equational reasoning for proving the correctness of graph transformation algorithms. Algebraic graphs let us avoid partial functions typically caused by `malformed graphs' that contain an edge referring to a non-existent vertex. This helps to liberate APIs of existing graph libraries from partial functions.   The algebra of graphs can represent directed, undirected, reflexive and transitive graphs, as well as hypergraphs, by appropriately choosing the set of underlying axioms. The flexibility of the approach is demonstrated by developing a library for constructing and transforming polymorphic graphs.},

  title = {The Essence of Ornaments},
  volume = {27},
  issn = {0956-7968, 1469-7653},
  abstract = {Functional programmers from all horizons strive to use, and sometimes abuse, their favorite type system in order to capture the invariants of their programs. A widely used tool in that trade consists in defining finely indexed datatypes. Operationally, these types classify the programmer's data, following the ML tradition. Logically, these types enforce the program invariants in a novel manner. This new programming pattern, by which one programs over inductive definitions to account for some invariants, lead to the development of a theory of ornaments (McBride, 2011 Ornamental Algebras, Algebraic Ornaments. Unpublished). However, ornaments originate as a dependently-typed object and may thus appear rather daunting to a functional programmer of the non-dependent kind. This article aims at presenting ornaments from first-principles and, in particular, to declutter their presentation from syntactic considerations. To do so, we shall give a sufficiently abstract model of indexed datatypes by means of many-sorted signatures. In this process, we formalize our intuition that an indexed datatype is the combination of a data-structure and a data-logic. Over this abstraction of datatypes, we shall recast the definition of ornaments, effectively giving a model of ornaments. Benefiting both from the operational and abstract nature of many-sorted signatures, ornaments should appear applicable and, one hopes, of interest beyond the type-theoretic circles, case in point being languages with generalized abstract datatypes or refinement types.},

Therefore, the more things are equal by conversion, the simpler it is to use a language based on type theory. Proof-irrelevance, stating that any two proofs of the same proposition are equal, is a possible way to extend conversion to make a type theory more powerful. However, this new power comes at a price if we integrate it naively, either by making type checking undecidable or by realizing new axioms\textemdash{}such as uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP)\textemdash{}that are incompatible with other extensions, such as univalence. In this paper, taking inspiration from homotopy type theory, we propose a general way to extend a type theory with definitional proof irrelevance, in a way that keeps type checking decidable and is compatible with univalence. We provide a new criterion to decide whether a proposition can be eliminated over a type (correcting and improving the so-called singleton elimination of Coq) by using techniques coming from recent development on dependent pattern matching without UIP. We show the generality of our approach by providing implementations for both Coq and Agda, both of which are planned to be integrated in future versions of those proof assistants.},

  isbn = {978-3-319-19797-5},
  abstract = {Generic programming (GP) is a form of abstraction in programming languages that serves to reduce code duplication by exploiting the regular structure of algebraic datatypes. Several different approaches to GP in Haskell have surfaced, giving rise to the problem of code duplication across GP libraries. Given the original goals of GP, this is a rather unfortunate turn of events. Fortunately, we can convert between the different representations of each approach, which allows us to ``borrow'' generic functions from different approaches, avoiding the need to reimplement every generic function in every single GP library.In previous work we have shown how existing GP libraries relate to each other. In this paper we go one step further and advocate ``hierarchical GP'': through proper design of different GP approaches, each library can fit neatly in a hierarchy, greatly minimizing the amount of supporting infrastructure necessary for each approach, and allowing each library to be specific and concise, while eliminating code duplication overall. We introduce a new library for GP in Haskell intended to sit at the top of the ``GP hierarchy''. This library contains a lot of structural information, and is not intended to be used directly. Instead, it is a good starting point for generating generic representations for other libraries. This approach is also suitable for being the only library with native compiler support; all other approaches can be obtained from this one by simple conversion of representations in plain Haskell code.},

By means of standard mathematical terminology as well as intuitive properties of bidirectional programs, we observe different ways to characterize lenses and show exactly how their laws interact. Like proper adjustment of optical lenses is essential for taking clear pictures, proper organization of lens laws is essential for forming a clear picture of different lens classes. Incidentally, the process of understanding bidirectional lenses clearly is quite similar to the process of taking a good picture.By showing that it is exactly the backward computation which defines lenses of a certain standard class, we provide an unusual perspective, as contemporary research tends to focus on the forward computation.},

  abstract = {Algebraic effect handlers are a recently popular approach for modelling side-effects that separates the syntax and semantics of effectful operations. The shape of syntax is captured by functors, and free monads over these functors denote syntax trees. The semantics is captured by algebras, and effect handlers pass these over the syntax trees to interpret them into a semantic domain.This approach is inherently modular: different functors can be composed to make trees with richer structure. Such trees are interpreted by applying several handlers in sequence, each removing the syntactic constructs it recognizes. Unfortunately, the construction and traversal of intermediate trees is painfully inefficient and has hindered the adoption of the handler approach.This paper explains how a sequence of handlers can be fused into one, so that multiple tree traversals can be reduced to a single one and no intermediate trees need to be allocated. At the heart of this optimization is keeping the notion of a free monad abstract, thus enabling a change of representation that opens up the possibility of fusion. We demonstrate how the ensuing code can be inlined at compile time to produce efficient handlers.},

However, the stronger judgement of the second model permits the elegant separation of the rely from the guarantee due to Hayes et al. and allows refinement-style reasoning. The generalisation to models that use binary relations for postconditions is also investigated. An operational semantics is derived and both models are shown to be sound with respect to execution.

  abstract = {Reasoning about programming languages with non-deterministic semantics entails many difficulties. For instance, to prove correctness of a compiler for such a language, one typically has to split the correctness property into a soundness and a completeness part, and then prove these two parts separately. In this paper, we present a set of proof rules to prove compiler correctness by a single proof in calculational style. The key observation that led to our proof rules is the fact that the soundness and completeness proof follow a similar pattern with only small differences. We condensed these differences into a single side condition for one of our proof rules. This side condition, however, is easily discharged automatically by a very simple form of proof search. We implemented this calculation framework in the Coq proof assistant. Apart from verifying a given compiler, our proof technique can also be used to formally derive \textendash{} from the semantics of the source language \textendash{} a compiler that is correct by construction. For such a derivation to succeed it is crucial that the underlying correctness argument proceeds as a single calculation, as opposed to separate calculations of the two directions of the correctness property. We demonstrate our technique by deriving a compiler for a simple language with interrupts.},

We show that bx are naturally modelled in terms of mutable state; in particular, the `set' operations are stateful functions. This leads naturally to considering bx that exploit other computational effects too, such as I/O, nondeterminism, and failure, all largely ignored in the bx literature to date. We present a semantic foundation for symmetric bidirectional transformations with effects. We build on the mature theory of monadic encapsulation of effects in functional programming, develop the equational theory and important combinators for effectful bx, and provide a prototype implementation in Haskell along with several illustrative examples.},

  abstract = {High-level synthesis or ``hardware compilation'' is a behavioural synthesis method in which circuits are specified using conventional programming languages. Such languages are generally recognised as more accessible than hardware description languages, and it is expected that their use would significantly increase design productivity. The Geometry of Synthesis is a new hardware compilation technique which achieves this goal in a semantic-directed fashion, by noting that functional programming languages and diagrammatic descriptions of hardware share a common mathematical structure, and by using the game-semantic model of the programming language to reduce all computational effects to signal-like message passing. As a consequence, this technique has mature support for higher-order functions [1], local (assignable) state [2], concurrency [3] and (affine) recursion [4]. Moreover, the compiler can support features such as separate compilation, libraries and a foreign-function interface [5]. The programming language of GoS, Verity, is an ``Algol-like'' language [6] extended with concurrency features [7]. The interplay between the call-by-name function mechanism and local effects, an approach specific to Algol, is the key ingredient which makes it possible for a large class of programs in this language to have finitely representable semantic models which can be synthesised as stand-alone static circuits. The compiler is available as an open-source download.},

It allows modelling user wishes by preference terms; they represent strict partial orders telling which database objects the user prefers over other ones. There are a number of constructors that allow combining simple preferences into quite complex, nested ones. A preference term is then used as a database query, and the results are the maximal objects according to the order it denotes. Depending on the size of the database, this can be computationally expensive. For optimisation, preference queries and the corresponding terms are transformed using a number of algebraic laws. So far, the correctness proofs for such laws have been performed by hand and in a point-wise fashion. We enrich the standard theory of relational databases to an algebraic framework that allows completely point-free reasoning about complex preferences. This black-box view is amenable to a treatment in first-order logic and hence to fully automated proofs using off-the-shelf verification tools. We exemplify the use of the calculus with some non-trivial laws, notably concerning so-called preference prefilters which perform a preselection to speed up the computation of the maximal objects proper.},

Examples of first-past-the-post games include so-called block and hidden patterns and the Penney-Ante game invented by Walter Penney. We formalise the abstract notion of a first-past-the-post game, and the process of extending a probability distribution on symbols of an alphabet to the plays of a game.Analysis of first-past-the-post games depends on a collection of simultaneous (non-linear) equations in languages. Essentially, the equations are due to Guibas and Odlyzko but they did not formulate them as equations in languages but as equations in generating functions detailing lengths of words.Penney-Ante games are two-player games characterised by a collection of regular, prefix-free languages. For such two-player games, we show how to use the equations in languages to calculate the probability of winning. The formula generalises a formula due to John H. Conway for the original Penney-Ante game. At no point in our analysis do we use generating functions. Even so, we are able to calculate probabilities and expected values. Generating functions do appear to become necessary when higher-order cumulatives (for example, the standard deviation) are also required.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a method for deriving controllers for real-time systems in which the components of the system operate at different time granularities. To this end, we incorporate the theory of time bands into action systems, which allows one to structure a system into multiple abstractions of time. The framework includes a logic that facilitates reasoning about different types of sampling errors and transient properties (i.e., properties that only hold for a brief amount of time), and we develop theorems for simplifying proofs of hardware/software interaction. We formalise true concurrency and define refinement for the parallel composition of action systems. Our method of derivation builds on the verify-while-develop paradigm, where the action system code is developed side-by-side with its proof.},

In particular, it has been shown that this law is equivalent to validity of the concurrency rule for Hoare triples. Unfortunately, the law does not hold in the relationally based setting of algebraic separation logic. However, we show that under mild conditions the reverse inequation (P ; R)*(Q ; S) {$\leq$} (P*Q) ; (R*S) still holds there. Separating conjunction * in that calculus can be interpreted as true concurrency on disjointly accessed resources. From the reverse exchange law we derive slightly restricted but still reasonably useful variants of the concurrency rule. Moreover, using a corresponding definition of locality, we obtain also a variant of the frame rule. By this, the relational setting can also be applied for modular and concurrency reasoning. Finally, we present several variations of the approach to further interpret the results.},

However, we argue that neither the program logics used in these systems, nor the decision procedures used to discharge verification conditions, are sufficient for establishing deep properties of modular software.In contrast, the Coq proof development environment provides a powerful program logic (CiC) coupled with an extensible, interactive environment that can combine deep insights from humans with automation to discharge deep proof obligations. Unfortunately, the language at the core of Coq is limited to purely functional programming.In the Ynot project, we are attempting to address this problem by extending Coq with a new type constructor (the Hoare-triple type), and a few carefully chosen axioms that can be used to build imperative programs in a style quite close to Haskell. I will report on our progress thus far, both in using Ynot to construct modular, extensible libraries for imperative programs, as well as our new compiler infrastructure for generating efficient code from Ynot programs.},

That refinement algebra does not contain features that are specific to probabilistic programs. For instance, it does not include a probabilistic choice operator, or probabilistic assertions and guards (tests), which may be used to represent correctness properties for probabilistic programs. In this paper we investigate how these features may be included in a refinement algebra.

  abstract = {The B\"ohm\textendash{}Jacopini theorem (B\"ohm and Jacopini, 1966) is a classical result of program schematology. It states that any deterministic flowchart program is equivalent to a while program. The theorem is usually formulated at the first-order interpreted or first-order uninterpreted (schematic) level, because the construction requires the introduction of auxiliary variables. Ashcroft and Manna (1972) and Kosaraju (1973) showed that this is unavoidable. As observed by a number of authors, a slightly more powerful structured programming construct, namely loop programs with multi-level breaks, is sufficient to represent all deterministic flowcharts without introducing auxiliary variables. Kosaraju (1973) established a strict hierarchy determined by the maximum depth of nesting allowed. In this paper we give a purely propositional account of these results. We reformulate the problems at the propositional level in terms of automata on guarded strings, the automata-theoretic counterpart to Kleene algebra with tests. Whereas the classical approaches do not distinguish between first-order and propositional levels of abstraction, we find that the purely propositional formulation allows a more streamlined mathematical treatment, using algebraic and topological concepts such as bisimulation and coinduction. Using these tools, we can give more mathematically rigorous formulations and simpler and more revealing proofs.},

  isbn = {978-3-540-70594-9},
  abstract = {Functional programmers happily use equational reasoning and induction to prove properties of recursive programs. To show properties of corecursive programs they employ coinduction, per perhaps less enthusiastically. Coinduction is often considered as a rather low-level proof method, especially, as it seems to depart rather radically from equational reasoning. In this talk we introduce an alternative proof technique based on unique fixed points. To make the idea concrete, consider the simplest example of a coinductive type: the type of streams, where a stream is an infinite sequence of elements. In a lazy functional language, such as Haskell, streams are easy to define and many textbooks on Haskell reproduce the folklore examples of Fibonacci or Hamming numbers defined by recursion equations over streams. One has to be a bit careful in formulating a recursion equation basically avoiding that the sequence defined swallows its own tail. However, if this care is exercised, the equation even possesses a unique solution, a fact that is not very widely appreciated. Uniqueness can be exploited to prove that two streams are equal: if they satisfy the same recursion equation, then they are! We will use this proof technique to infer some intriguing facts about particular streams and to develop the basics of finite calculus. Quite attractively, the resulting proofs have a strong equational flavour. In a nutshell, the proof method brings equational reasoning to the coworld. Of course, it is by no means restricted to streams and can be used equally well to prove properties of infinite trees or the observational equivalence of instances of an abstract datatype.},

Although this algorithm does not rely on normalization by evaluation explicitly, we show that similar ideas can be employed for its verification. In particular, our proof uses the new notions of contextual reification and strong semantic equality.The algorithm is part of a bi-directional type checking algorithm which checks whether a normal term has a certain semantic type, a technique used in the proof assistants Agda and Epigram. We work with an abstract notion of semantic domain in order to accommodate a variety of possible implementation techniques, such as normal forms, weak head normal forms, closures, and compiled code.

  abstract = {Nested datatypes are families of datatypes that are indexed over all types such that the constructors may relate different family members. Moreover, the argument types of the constructors refer to indices given by expressions where the family name may occur. Especially in this case of true nesting, there is no direct support by theorem provers to guarantee termination of functions that traverse these data structures.A joint article with A. Abel and T. Uustalu (TCS 333(1\textendash{}2), pp. 3\textendash{}66, 2005) proposes iteration schemes that guarantee termination not by structural requirements but just by polymorphic typing. They are generic in the sense that no specific syntactic form of the underlying datatype ``functor'' is required. In subsequent work (accepted for the Journal of Functional Programming), the author introduced an induction principle for the verification of programs obtained from Mendler-style iteration of rank 2, which is one of those schemes, and justified it in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions through an implementation in the theorem prover Coq.The new contribution is an extension of this work to generalized Mendler iteration (introduced in Abel et al, cited above), leading to a map fusion theorem for the obtained iterative functions. The results and their implementation in Coq are used for a case study on a representation of untyped lambda calculus with explicit flattening. Substitution is proven to fulfill two of the three monad laws, the third only for ``hereditarily canonical'' terms, but this is rectified by a relativisation of the whole construction to those terms.},

Guards are predicates and control policies are expressed by tuples of guards. The optimal control policy refines the control policy of the given system. It is generated from the target predicate by an iteration based on backwards induction. This iterative procedure amounts to a variant of the symbolic algorithm generating the reachability precondition; the latter characterizes the states from which some system execution reaches the target set. The main difference is the introduction of greedy and cost-dependent iteration steps.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses stepwise refinement of pointer programs in the framework of refinement calculus. We augment the underlying logic with formulas of separation logic and then introduce a pair of new predicate transformers, called separating assertion and separating assumption. The new predicate transformers are derived from separating conjunction and separating implication, which are fundamental logical connectives in separation logic. They represent primitive forms of heap allocation/deallocation operators and the basic pointer statements can be specified by means of them. We derive several refinement laws that are useful for stepwise refinement and demonstrate the use of the laws in the context of correctness preserving transformations that are intended for improved memory usage.The formal development is carried out in the framework of higher-order logic and is based on Back and Preoteasa's axiomatization of state space and its extension to the heap storage [BP05, Pre06]. All the results have been implemented and verified in the theorem prover PVS.},

A first example of an omniscient set is the one-point compactification of the natural numbers, also known as the generic convergent sequence. We relate this to Grilliot's and Ishihara's Tricks. We generalize this example to many infinite subsets of the Cantor space. These subsets turn out to be ordinals in a constructive sense, with respect to the lexicographic order, satisfying both a well-foundedness condition with respect to decidable subsets, and transfinite induction restricted to decidable predicates. The use of simple types allows us to reach any ordinal below {$\epsilon$}Q, and richer type systems allow us to get higher.},

  abstract = {This is a tutorial for mathematically inclined functional programmers, based on previously published, peered reviewed theoretical work. We discuss a higher-type functional, written here in the functional programming language Haskell, which (1) optimally plays sequential games, (2) implements a computational version of the Tychonoff Theorem from topology, and (3) realizes the DoubleNegation Shift from logic and proof theory. The functional makes sense for finite and infinite (lazy) lists, and in the binary case it amounts to an operation that is available in any (strong) monad. In fact, once we define this monad in Haskell, it turns out that this amazingly versatile functional is already available in Haskell, in the standard prelude, called sequence, which iterates this binary operation. Therefore Haskell proves that this functional is even more versatile than anticipated, as the function sequence was introduced for other purposes by the language designers, in particular the iteration of a list of monadic effects (but effects are not what we discuss here).},

  volume = {abs/1903.10677},
  abstract = {Convolution is a broadly useful operation with applications including signal
processing, machine learning, probability, optics, polynomial multiplication,
and efficient parsing. Usually, however, this operation is understood and
implemented in more specialized forms, hiding commonalities and limiting
usefulness. This paper formulates convolution in the common algebraic framework
of semirings and semimodules and populates that framework with various
representation types. One of those types is the grand abstract template and
itself generalizes to the free semimodule monad. Other representations serve
varied uses and performance trade-offs, with implementations calculated from
simple and regular specifications.
  Of particular interest is Brzozowski's method for regular expression
matching. Uncovering the method's essence frees it from syntactic
manipulations, while generalizing from boolean to weighted membership (such as
multisets and probability distributions) and from sets to n-ary relations. The
classic trie data structure then provides an elegant and efficient alternative
to syntax.
  Pleasantly, polynomial arithmetic requires no additional implementation
effort, works correctly with a variety of representations, and handles
multivariate polynomials and power series with ease. Image convolution also
falls out as a special case.},

  abstract = {We study different formalizations of finite sets in homotopy type theory to obtain a general definition that exhibits both the computational facilities and the proof principles expected from finite sets. We use higher inductive types to define the type K(A) of "finite sets over type A" \`a la Kuratowski without assuming that K(A) has decidable equality. We show how to define basic functions and prove basic properties after which we give two applications of our definition.  On the foundational side, we use K to define the notions of "Kuratowski-finite type" and "Kuratowski-finite subobject", which we contrast with established notions, e.g. Bishop-finite types and enumerated types. We argue that Kuratowski-finiteness is the most general and flexible one of those and we define the usual operations on finite types and subobjects.  From the computational perspective, we show how to use K(A) for an abstract interface for well-known finite set implementations such as tree- and list-like data structures. This implies that a function defined on a concrete finite sets implementation can be obtained from a function defined on the abstract finite sets K(A) and that correctness properties are inherited. Hence, HoTT is the ideal setting for data refinement. Beside this, we define bounded quantification, which lifts a decidable property on A to one on K(A).},

  abstract = {Dependently-typed programming languages provide a powerful tool for establishing code correctness. However, it can be hard for newcomers to learn how to employ the advanced type system of such languages effectively. For simply-typed languages, several techniques have been devised to generate helpful error messages and suggestions for the programmer. We adapt these techniques to dependently-typed languages, to facilitate their more widespread adoption. In particular, we modify a higher-order unification algorithm that is used to resolve and type-check implicit arguments. We augment this algorithm with replay graphs, allowing for a global heuristic analysis of a unification problem-set, error-tolerant typing, which allows type-checking to continue after errors are found, and counter-factual unification, which makes error messages less affected by the order in which types are checked. A formalization of our algorithm is presented with an outline of its correctness. We implement replay graphs, and compare the generated error messages to those from existing languages, highlighting the improvements we achieved.},

  abstract = {One Monad to Prove Them All is a modern fairy tale about curiosity and perseverance, two important properties of a successful PhD student. We follow the PhD student Mona on her adventure of proving properties about Haskell programs in the proof assistant Coq. On the one hand, as a PhD student in computer science Mona observes an increasing demand for correct software products. In particular, because of the large amount of existing software, verifying existing software products becomes more important. Verifying programs in the functional programming language Haskell is no exception. On the other hand, Mona is delighted to see that communities in the area of theorem proving are becoming popular. Thus, Mona sets out to learn more about the interactive theorem prover Coq and verifying Haskell programs in Coq. To prove properties about a Haskell function in Coq, Mona has to translate the function into Coq code. As Coq programs have to be total and Haskell programs are often not, Mona has to model partiality explicitly in Coq. In her quest for a solution Mona finds an ancient manuscript that explains how properties about Haskell functions can be proven in the proof assistant Agda by translating Haskell programs into monadic Agda programs. By instantiating the monadic program with a concrete monad instance the proof can be performed in either a total or a partial setting. Mona discovers that the proposed transformation does not work in Coq due to a restriction in the termination checker. In fact the transformation does not work in Agda anymore as well, as the termination checker in Agda has been improved. We follow Mona on an educational journey through the land of functional programming where she learns about concepts like free monads and containers as well as basics and restrictions of proof assistants like Coq. These concepts are well-known individually, but their interplay gives rise to a solution for Mona's problem based on the originally proposed monadic tranformation that has not been presented before. When Mona starts to test her approach by proving a statement about simple Haskell functions, she realizes that her approach has an additional advantage over the original idea in Agda. Mona's final solution not only works for a specific monad instance but even allows her to prove monad-generic properties. Instead of proving properties over and over again for specific monad instances she is able to prove properties that hold for all monads representable by a container-based instance of the free monad. In order to strengthen her confidence in the practicability of her approach, Mona evaluates her approach in a case study that compares two implementations for queues. In order to share the results with other functional programmers the fairy tale is available as a literate Coq file. If you are a citizen of the land of functional programming or are at least familiar with its customs, had a journey that involved reasoning about functional programs of your own, or are just a curious soul looking for the next story about monads and proofs, then this tale is for you.},

  abstract = {Functional composition, the application of one function to the results of another function, has a long history in the mathematics community, particularly in the context of polynomials and rational functions. This thesis articulates and explores a general framework for the use of functional composition in the context of signal processing. Its many potential applications to signal processing include utilization of the composition of simpler or lower order subfunctions to exactly or approximately represent a given function or data sequence. Although functional composition currently appears implicitly in a number of established signal processing algorithms, it is shown how the more general context developed and exploited in this thesis leads to significantly improved results for several important classes of functions that are ubiquitous in signal processing such as polynomials, frequency responses and discrete multivariate functions. Specifically, the functional composition framework is exploited in analyzing, designing and extending modular filters, separating marginalization computations into more manageable subcomputations and representing discrete sequences with fewer degrees of freedom than their length and region of support with implications for sparsity and efficiency.},

This allows one to use Moggi's monadic metalanguage to give an interpretation of a language, Rml, into type theory. Rml is a functional language with a primitive for probabilistic choice. This formalization was the semantical basis for the Certicrypt system for verifying security protocols. The Easycrypt proof assistant is still based on the same semantics. We improve on the formalization by using homotopy type theory which provides e.g. quotients and functional extensionality. Moreover, homotopy type theory allows us to use synthetic topology to present a theory which also includes non-discrete (`continuous') data types, like [0, 1]. Such data types are relevant, for instance, in machine learning and differential privacy. Our axioms are justified by KleeneVesley realizability, a standard model for computation with continuous data types.},

@phdthesis{szymczak_programming_2018,
  title = {Programming Language Semantics as a Foundation for {{Bayesian}} Inference},
  abstract = {Bayesian modelling, in which our prior belief about the distribution on model parameters 
is updated by observed data, is a popular approach to statistical data analysis. 
However, writing specific inference algorithms for Bayesian models by hand is time-consuming 
and requires significant machine learning expertise. 
Probabilistic programming promises to make Bayesian modelling easier and more 
accessible by letting the user express a generative model as a short computer program 
(with random variables), leaving inference to the generic algorithm provided by the 
compiler of the given language. However, it is not easy to design a probabilistic programming 
language correctly and define the meaning of programs expressible in it. 
Moreover, the inference algorithms used by probabilistic programming systems usually 
lack formal correctness proofs and bugs have been found in some of them, which 
limits the confidence one can have in the results they return. 
In this work, we apply ideas from the areas of programming language theory and 
statistics to show that probabilistic programming can be a reliable tool for Bayesian 
inference. The first part of this dissertation concerns the design, semantics and type 
system of a new, substantially enhanced version of the Tabular language. Tabular is a 
schema-based probabilistic language, which means that instead of writing a full program, 
the user only has to annotate the columns of a schema with expressions generating 
corresponding values. By adopting this paradigm, Tabular aims to be user-friendly, 
but this unusual design also makes it harder to define the syntax and semantics correctly 
and reason about the language. We define the syntax of a version of Tabular extended 
with user-defined functions and pseudo-deterministic queries, design a dependent type 
system for this language and endow it with a precise semantics. We also extend Tabular 
with a concise formula notation for hierarchical linear regressions, define the type 
system of this extended language and show how to reduce it to pure Tabular. 
In the second part of this dissertation, we present the first correctness proof for a 
Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm for a higher-order probabilistic language. We 
define a measure-theoretic semantics of the language by means of an operationally-defined 
density function on program traces (sequences of random variables) and a map 
from traces to program outputs. We then show that the distribution of samples returned 
by our algorithm (a variant of ``Trace MCMC'' used by the Church language) matches 
the program semantics in the limit.},

  abstract = {We develop an algebraic underpinning of backtracking monad transformers in
the general setting of monoidal categories. As our main technical device, we
introduce Eilenberg--Moore monoids, which combine monoids with algebras for
strong monads. We show that Eilenberg--Moore monoids coincide with algebras for
the list monad transformer ('done right') known from Haskell libraries.
  From this, we obtain a number of results, including the facts that the list
monad transformer is indeed a monad, a transformer, and an instance of the
MonadPlus class. Finally, we construct an Eilenberg--Moore monoid of
endomorphisms, which, via the codensity monad construction, yields a
continuation-based implementation a la Hinze.},

  abstract = {We generalise Cayley's theorem for monoids by providing an explicit formula for a (multi-sorted) equational theory represented by the type {$\mathsl{P}\mathsl{X}\rightarrow\mathsl{X}$}PX{$\rightarrow$}XPX \textbackslash{}rightarrow X, where {$\mathsl{P}$}PP is an arbitrary polynomial endofunctor with natural coefficients. From the computational perspective, examples of effects given by such theories include backtracking nondeterminism (obtained with the original Cayley representation {$\mathsl{X}\rightarrow\mathsl{X}$}X{$\rightarrow$}XX \textbackslash{}rightarrow X), finite mutable state (obtained with {$\mathsl{n}\rightarrow\mathsl{X}$}n{$\rightarrow$}Xn \textbackslash{}rightarrow X, for a constant n), and their different combinations (via {$\mathsl{n}\times\mathsl{X}\rightarrow\mathsl{X}$}n\texttimes{}X{$\rightarrow$}Xn \textbackslash{}times X \textbackslash{}rightarrow X or {$\mathsl{X}\mathsl{n}\rightarrow\mathsl{X}$}Xn{$\rightarrow$}XX\^n \textbackslash{}rightarrow X). Moreover, we show that monads induced by such theories are implementable using the type formers available in programming languages based on a polymorphic {$\mathsl{\Lambda}\lambda\backslash$}lambda -calculus, both as compositions of algebraic datatypes and as continuation-like monads. We give a set-theoretic model of the latter in terms of Barr-dinatural transformations. We also introduce CayMon, a tool that takes a polynomial as an input and generates the corresponding equational theory together with the two implementations of the induced monad in Haskell.},

While solutions exist, they fall short in one of two ways: some are too intrusive, because they require significant changes to Prolog's underlying implementation; others are lacking a clean semantic grounding. We resolve both of these issues in this paper. We derive a solution that is both lightweight and principled. We do so by starting from a functional specification of Prolog based on monads, and extend this with the effect handlers approach to capture the dynamic search tree as syntax. Effect handlers then express heuristics in terms of tree transformations. Moreover, we can declaratively express many heuristics as trees themselves that are combined with search problems using a generic entwining handler. Our solution is not restricted to a functional model: we show how to implement this technique as a library in Prolog by means of delimited continuations.},

`f' [ratio ][ratio ] {$\alpha$} [Rarr ] {$\beta$} that can return many results or none, we replace it by a
genuine function f [ratio ][ratio ] {$\alpha$} {$\rightarrow$} {$\beta$} stream that returns a lazy stream of results, and
rely on lazy evaluation to compute the answers one at a time, and only as they are needed. For
the sake of clarity, I will distinguish between the types of finite lists ({$\alpha$} list) and of
potentially infinite, lazy streams ({$\alpha$} stream), though both may be implemented in the
same way. Following the conventions used in ML, type constructors follow their argument types.},

  title = {Search {{Combinators}}},
  abstract = {The ability to model search in a constraint solver can be an essential asset for solving combinatorial problems. However, existing infrastructure for defining search heuristics is often inadequate. Either modeling capabilities are extremely limited or users are faced with a general-purpose programming language whose features are not tailored towards writing search heuristics. As a result, major improvements in performance may remain unexplored. This article introduces search combinators, a lightweight and solver-independent method that bridges the gap between a conceptually simple modeling language for search (high-level, functional and naturally compositional) and an efficient implementation (low-level, imperative and highly non-modular). By allowing the user to define application-tailored search strategies from a small set of primitives, search combinators effectively provide a rich domain-specific language (DSL) for modeling search to the user. Remarkably, this DSL comes at a low implementation cost to the developer of a constraint solver. The article discusses two modular implementation approaches and shows, by empirical evaluation, that search combinators can be implemented without overhead compared to a native, direct implementation in a constraint solver.},

It is a monad and it constitutes a constructive alternative to the maybe monad. It is often desirable to consider two delayed computations equal, if they terminate with equal values, whenever one of them terminates. The equivalence relation underlying this identification is called weak bisimilarity. In type theory, one commonly replaces quotients with setoids. In this approach, the delay monad quotiented by weak bisimilarity is still a monad. In this paper, we consider Hofmann's alternative approach [6] of extending type theory with inductive-like quotient types. In this setting, it is difficult to define the intended monad multiplication for the quotiented datatype. We give a solution where we postulate some principles, crucially proposition extensionality and the (semi-classical) axiom of countable choice. We have fully formalized our results in the Agda dependently typed programming language.},

Computing this function quickly and accurately is a basic step in many schemes for deciding how to act in stochastic environments. There are efficient algorithms which compute value functions for special types of MDPs: for deterministic MDPs with S states and A actions, Dijkstra's algorithm runs in time O(AS log S). And, in single-action MDPs (Markov chains), standard linear-algebraic algorithms find the value function in time O(S3), or faster by taking advantage of sparsity or good conditioning. Algorithms for solving general MDPs can take much longer: we are not aware of any speed guarantees better than those for comparably-sized linear programs. We present a family of algorithms which reduce to Dijkstra's algorithm when applied to deterministic MDPs, and to standard techniques for solving linear equations when applied to Markov chains. More importantly, we demonstrate experimentally that these algorithms perform well when applied to MDPs which ``almost'' have the required special structure.},

Streams, infinite sequences of elements, live in a coworld: they are given by a coinductive datatype, operations on streams are implemented by corecursive programs, and proofs are typically concocted using coinduction. This paper offers an alternative to coinduction. Suitably restricted, stream equations possess unique solutions. This property gives rise to a simple and attractive proof technique, essentially bringing equational reasoning to the coworld. We redevelop the theory of recurrences, finite calculus and generating functions using streams and stream operators, building on the cornerstone of unique solutions. The paper contains a sm\"org\aa{}sbord of examples: we study recursion elimination, investigate the binary carry sequence, explore Sprague-Grundy numbers and present two proofs of Moessner's Theorem. The calculations benefit from the rich structure of streams. As the type of streams is an applicative functor we can effortlessly lift operations and their properties to streams. In combination with Haskell's facilities for overloading, this greatly contributes to conciseness of notation. The development is indeed constructive: streams and stream operators are implemented in Haskell, usually by one-liners. The resulting calculus or library, if you wish, is elegant and fun to use.},

Despite its popularity the list monad suffers from serious drawbacks: It relies in an essential way on lazy evaluation, it is inefficient, and it is not modular. We develop an alternative based on continuations, which remedies these shortcomings. Essential use is made of constructor classes and second-order types, which sets the work apart from other approaches. Continuation-based backtracking monads behave amazingly well in practice: If an optimizing compiler is used, their performance is commensurate to that of logic languages. The class mechanism greatly eases the task of adding features to the basic machinery. We study three extensions in detail: control operations, all solutions functions, and exception handling.},

We are then able to define search and search strategies as first-class objects that can themselves be built or extended by composable search transformers. Search transformers give a powerful and unifying approach to viewing search in constraint programming, and the resulting constraint programming system is first class and extremely flexible.},

Yet these benefits are seldom enjoyed in functional programming, because the existing features for non-strictness, sharing, and non-determinism in functional languages are tricky to combine. We present a practical way to write purely functional lazy non-deterministic programs that are efficient and perspicuous. We achieve this goal by embedding the programs into existing languages (such as Haskell, SML, and OCaml) with high-quality implementations, by making choices lazily and representing data with non-deterministic components, by working with custom monadic data types and search strategies, and by providing equational laws for the programmer to reason about their code.},

Continuations also give rise to a third sort of combination, that given by applying the continuations monad transformer to an algebraic effect. We investigate the extent to which sum and tensor extend from algebraic effects to arbitrary monads, and the extent to which Felleisen et~al.'s C operator extends from continuations to its combination with algebraic effects. To do all this, we use Dubuc's characterisation of strong monads in terms of enriched large Lawvere theories.},

First, we prove that for every analytic endofunctor on Set there exists a canonical distributive law over any commutative monad M, hence a lifting of that endofunctor to the Kleisli category of M. Then, for an arbitrary distributive law {$\lambda$} of an endofunctor H on Set over a monad M we introduce {$\lambda$}-cias. The cias for the corresponding lifting of H (called Kleisli-cias) form a full subcategory of the category of {$\lambda$}-cias. For various monads of interest we prove that free Kleisli-cias coincide with free {$\lambda$}-cias, and these free algebras are given by free algebras for H. Finally, for three concrete examples of monads we prove that Kleisli-cias and {$\lambda$}-cias coincide and give a characterisation of those algebras.},

  abstract = {Packrat parsing is a novel technique for implementing parsers in a lazy functional programming language. A packrat parser provides the power and flexibility of top-down parsing with backtracking and unlimited lookahead, but nevertheless guarantees linear parse time. Any language defined by an LL(k) or LR(k) grammar can be recognized by a packrat parser, in addition to many languages that conventional linear-time algorithms do not support. This additional power simplifies the handling of common syntactic idioms such as the widespread but troublesome longest-match rule, enables the use of sophisticated disambiguation strategies such as syntactic and semantic predicates, provides better grammar composition properties, and allows lexical analysis to be integrated seamlessly into parsing. Yet despite its power, packrat parsing shares the same simplicity and elegance as recursive descent parsing; in fact converting a backtracking recursive descent parser into a linear-time packrat parser often involves only a fairly straightforward structural change. This paper describes packrat parsing informally with emphasis on its use in practical applications, and explores its advantages and disadvantages with respect to the more conventional alternatives.},

  abstract = {Rational sequences are possibly infinite sequences with a finite number of distinct suffixes. In this paper, we present different implementations of rational sequences in Martin\textendash{}L\"of type theory. First, we literally translate the above definition of rational sequence into the language of type theory, i.e., we construct predicates on possibly infinite sequences expressing the finiteness of the set of suffixes. In type theory, there exist several inequivalent notions of finiteness. We consider two of them, listability and Noetherianness, and show that in the implementation of rational sequences the two notions are interchangeable. Then we introduce the type of lists with backpointers, which is an inductive implementation of rational sequences. Lists with backpointers can be unwound into rational sequences, and rational sequences can be truncated into lists with backpointers. As an example, we see how to convert the fractional representation of a rational number into its decimal representation and vice versa.},

  abstract = {Spivey has recently presented a novel functional representation that supports the efficient composition, or merging, of coroutine pipelines for processing streams of data. This representation was inspired by Shivers and Might's three-continuation approach and is shown to be equivalent to a simple yet inefficient executable specification. Unfortunately, neither Shivers and Might's original work nor the equivalence proof sheds much light on the underlying principles allowing the derivation of this efficient representation from its specification.This paper gives the missing insight by reconstructing a systematic derivation in terms of known transformation steps from the simple specification to the efficient representation. This derivation sheds light on the limitations of the representation and on its applicability to other settings. In particular, it has enabled us to obtain a similar representation for pipes featuring two-way communication, similar to the Haskell pipes library. Our benchmarks confirm that this two-way representation retains the same improved performance characteristics.},
