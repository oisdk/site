  isbn = {978-1-58113-605-0},
  abstract = {One popular use for Haskell in recent years has been as a host language for domain-specific embedded languages. But how can one embed a postfix language in Haskell, given that Haskell only supports prefix and infix syntax? This paper describes several such embeddings for increasingly complex postfix languages.},
