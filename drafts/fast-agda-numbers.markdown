title: Writing a Fast Number Implementation in Agda
tags: Agda
---

I've been messing around with some binary number implementations in Agda
recently and I have come across a few tricks to make the representation work
quickly.
In this post I'll go through a few of those tricks, which might be helpful for
other people writing Agda and struggling through its slowness.

# The Representation

First things first, I'm using zeroless binary numbers as the basic
representation.
They look like the following:

```agda
infixr 8 1ᵇ_ 2ᵇ_
data 𝔹 : Type₀ where
  0ᵇ : 𝔹
  1ᵇ_ 2ᵇ_ : 𝔹 → 𝔹
```

As you can see, this type is basically a list of booleans: it might be tempting,
therefore, to redefine the type in terms of lists and bools:

```agda
𝔹 : Type₀
𝔹 = List Bool

infixr 8 1ᵇ_ 2ᵇ_
pattern 0ᵇ = []
pattern 1ᵇ_ xs = false ∷ xs
pattern 2ᵇ_ xs = true  ∷ xs
```

Unfortunately, though, that will incur a pretty serious performance hit.
Agda tends to slow down when used with complex, nested types: the simple
non-parameterised type we defined first tends to work much faster.

# Conversion

The next thing to consider is the function to convert to and from the natural
numbers.
The conversion to is as follows:

```agda
⟦_⇓⟧ : 𝔹 → ℕ
⟦ 0ᵇ ⇓⟧ = 0
⟦ 1ᵇ xs ⇓⟧ = 1 + ⟦ xs ⇓⟧ * 2
⟦ 2ᵇ xs ⇓⟧ = 2 + ⟦ xs ⇓⟧ * 2
```

By using `+` and `*` here, we can leverage Agda's faster built-in natural number
types.
Those functions will call out to actually fast (ish) implementations on
Haskell's `Integer` type.
The actual expressions we use are quite important for proofs: we want to write
`n * 2` instead of `2 * n`, for instance, wherever possible.
This allows the proof that the binary numbers are isomorphic to the Peano to be
quite short:

<details>
<summary>Proof of isomorphism</summary>

```agda
inc-suc : ∀ x → ⟦ inc x ⇓⟧ ≡ suc ⟦ x ⇓⟧
inc-suc 0ᵇ     i = 1
inc-suc (1ᵇ x) i = 2 ℕ.+ ⟦ x ⇓⟧ ℕ.* 2
inc-suc (2ᵇ x) i = suc (inc-suc x i ℕ.* 2)

inc-2*-1ᵇ : ∀ n → inc ⟦ n ℕ.* 2 ⇑⟧ ≡ 1ᵇ ⟦ n ⇑⟧
inc-2*-1ᵇ zero    i = 1ᵇ 0ᵇ
inc-2*-1ᵇ (suc n) i = inc (inc (inc-2*-1ᵇ n i))

𝔹-rightInv : ∀ x → ⟦ ⟦ x ⇑⟧ ⇓⟧ ≡ x
𝔹-rightInv zero    = refl
𝔹-rightInv (suc x) = inc-suc ⟦ x ⇑⟧ ; cong suc (𝔹-rightInv x)

𝔹-leftInv : ∀ x → ⟦ ⟦ x ⇓⟧ ⇑⟧ ≡ x
𝔹-leftInv 0ᵇ = refl
𝔹-leftInv (1ᵇ x) =           inc-2*-1ᵇ ⟦ x ⇓⟧  ; cong 1ᵇ_ (𝔹-leftInv x)
𝔹-leftInv (2ᵇ x) = cong inc (inc-2*-1ᵇ ⟦ x ⇓⟧) ; cong 2ᵇ_ (𝔹-leftInv x)

𝔹⇔ℕ : 𝔹 ⇔ ℕ
𝔹⇔ℕ .fun = ⟦_⇓⟧
𝔹⇔ℕ .inv = ⟦_⇑⟧
𝔹⇔ℕ .rightInv = 𝔹-rightInv
𝔹⇔ℕ .leftInv  = 𝔹-leftInv
```
</details>

The other function, converting *from* a peano number, is where performance
becomes a little trickier to achieve:

```agda
⟦_⇑⟧ : ℕ → 𝔹
⟦ zero ⇑⟧ = 0ᵇ
⟦ suc n ⇑⟧ = inc ⟦ n ⇑⟧
```

# Strictness

The above conversion from the natural numbers is a classic example of a
space-leak in a language like Haskell.
Perhaps a little surprisingly, laziness itself isn't the culprit: the space leak
above would occur in a strict language also.
The problem is that we will build up a long chain of calls to `inc` before
evaluating any of them.
Where laziness does become a problem is when we attempt to solve the problem in
the traditional way: with an accumulator.

```agda
⟦_⇑⟧ : ℕ → 𝔹
⟦_⇑⟧ = go 0ᵇ
  where
  go : 𝔹 → ℕ → 𝔹
  go a zero    = a
  go a (suc n) = go (inc a) n
```

Here, laziness will preserve the space leak, since we don't force the evaluation
of `a` at any point.

Agda does have some strictness primitives, however, which we can use with the
following helper functions:

```agda
infixr 0 _$!_
_$!_ : {A : Type a} {B : A → Type b} → (∀ x → B x) → ∀ x → B x
f $! x = primForce x f
{-# INLINE _$!_ #-}

infixr 0 let-bang
let-bang : {A : Type a} {B : A → Type b} → ∀ x → (∀ x → B x) → B x
let-bang = primForce
{-# INLINE let-bang #-}

syntax let-bang v (λ x → e) = let! x =! v in! e
```

This transforms our conversion function into the following:

```agda
⟦_⇑⟧ : ℕ → 𝔹
⟦_⇑⟧ = go 0ᵇ
  where
  go : 𝔹 → ℕ → 𝔹
  go a zero    = a
  go a (suc n) = let! a′ =! inc a in! go a′ n
```

(you do have to write a strict version of `inc` as well)

Actually, it is a little cleaner to recognise the more general pattern here, and
define the functions as strict folds on `ℕ`:

```agda
foldr-ℕ : (A → A) → A → ℕ → A
foldr-ℕ f b zero    = b
foldr-ℕ f b (suc n) = f (foldr-ℕ f b n)

foldl-ℕ-go : (A → A) → ℕ → A → A
foldl-ℕ-go f zero    x = x
foldl-ℕ-go f (suc n) x = foldl-ℕ-go f n $! f x

foldl-ℕ : (A → A) → A → ℕ → A
foldl-ℕ f x n = foldl-ℕ-go f n $! x
```

Then we can prove that both the strict and lazy forms of these functions are
equivalent:

```agda
f-comm : ∀ (f : A → A) x n → f (foldr-ℕ f x n) ≡ foldr-ℕ f (f x) n
f-comm f x zero    i = f x
f-comm f x (suc n) i = f (f-comm f x n i)

foldl-ℕ-foldr : ∀ f (x : A) n → foldr-ℕ f x n ≡ foldl-ℕ f x n
foldl-ℕ-foldr f x zero    = sym ($!-≡ (foldl-ℕ-go f zero) x)
foldl-ℕ-foldr f x (suc n) = f-comm f x n 
                          ; foldl-ℕ-foldr f (f x) n 
                          ; sym ($!-≡ (foldl-ℕ-go f (suc n)) x)
```

This means we can define our conversion from the Peano numbers in the strict
form, but prove things about the lazy form.

# Termination

There is a way to convert from `ℕ` that is faster still: we could rely on Agda's
built-in `div` and `mod` functions to avoid the `inc` step altogether.

```agda
⟦_⇑⟧ : ℕ → 𝔹
⟦ zero  ⇑⟧ = 0ᵇ
⟦ suc n ⇑⟧ =
  if even n
  then 1ᵇ ⟦ n ÷ 2 ⇑⟧
  else 2ᵇ ⟦ n ÷ 2 ⇑⟧
```

This is asymptotically faster than any implementation which uses `inc`: however
it doesn't pass the termination checker.
As of yet, I haven't figured out how to get it to pass the termination checker
without incurring a serious performance penalty.
