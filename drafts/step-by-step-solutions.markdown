title: Step-By-Step Solutions, Formally
tags: Agda
---

This post today is going to be about a small bit from my undergraduate thesis:
how to write a formal, verified program that automates proofs about arithmetic
expressions, and also *explains* the proofs in a step-by-step way.
Basically, what would Wolfram Alpha look like if it were written in Agda.

# The Goal: Step-By-Step Solutions
# The Solver (Briefly)
# Setoid Hell
# It's About the Journey, not the Destination
# What if you wanted to implement this yourself?
