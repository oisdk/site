<p>The large-scale structure of executing a computation can often be
thought of as being separated into distinct phases. But the most natural
form in which to specify that computation may well have a different and
conflicting structure. For example, the computation might consist of
gathering data from some locations, processing it, then distributing the
results back to the same locations; it may be executed in three
phases—gather, process, distribute—but mostly conveniently specified
orthogonally—by location. We have recently shown that this multi-phase
structure can be expressed as a novel applicative functor (also known as
an idiom, or lax monoidal functor). Here we summarize the idea from the
perspective of software architecture. At the end, we speculate about
applications to choreography and multi-tier architecture.</p>

      <dt>Breadth-First Traversal via Staging — September 22, 2022</dt>
      <dd><p>Presented at MPC 2022.</p>
<p><a href="pdfs/breadth-first-traversals-via-staging.pdf">Pdf available
here.</a></p>
<p>An effectful traversal of a data structure iterates over every
element, in some predetermined order, collecting computational effects
in the process. Depth-first effectful traversal of a tree is
straightforward to define compositionally, since it precisely follows
the shape of the data. What about breadth-first effectful traversal? An
indirect route is to factorize the data structure into shape and
contents, traverse the contents, then rebuild the data structure with
new contents. We show that this can instead be done directly using
staging, expressed using a construction related to free applicative
functors. The staged traversals lend themselves well to fusion; we prove
a novel fusion rule for effectful traversals, and use it in another
solution to Bird’s `repmin’ problem.</p>

      <dt>Algebras for Weighted Search — August 19, 2021</dt>
      <dd><p>Presented at ICFP 2021.</p>
<p><a href="pdfs/algebras-for-weighted-search.pdf">Pdf available

<p>Weighted search is an essential component of many fundamental and
useful algorithms. Despite this, it is relatively under explored as a
computational effect, receiving not nearly as much attention as either
depth- or breadth-first search. This paper explores the algebraic
underpinning of weighted search, and demonstrates how to implement it as
a monad transformer. The development first explores breadth-first
search, which can be expressed as a polynomial over semirings. These
polynomials are generalised to the free semimodule monad to capture a
wide range of applications, including probability monads, polynomial
monads, and monads for weighted search. Finally, a monad transformer
based on the free semimodule monad is introduced. Applying optimisations
to this type yields an implementation of pairing heaps, which is then
used to implement Dijkstra’s algorithm and efficient probabilistic
sampling. The construction is formalised in Cubical Agda and implemented
in Haskell.</p>

      <dt>Automatically and Efficiently Illustrating Polynomial Equalities in Agda — April  8, 2019</dt>
      <dd><p>BSc thesis.</p>
<p><a href="pdfs/bsc-thesis.pdf">Pdf available here.</a></p>
<p>We present a new library which automates the construction of
equivalence proofs between polynomials over commutative rings and
semirings in the programming language Agda. It is significantly faster
than Agda’s existing solver. We use reflection to provide a sim- ple
interface to the solver, and demonstrate how to use the constructed
proofs to provide step-by-step solutions.</p>
